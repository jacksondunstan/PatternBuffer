# C# PatternBuffer

This is the default implementation of PatternBuffers in C#. 

For usage notes on the pbc-cs.exe command line application, see this related [README](https://tbd/lol).

## Projects

The C# PatternBuffer implementation is comprised of several sub-projects. They are described below.

### PatternBuffer

The base library for C# PatternBuffers. This is a run-time dependency and can be included as-is. Generated C# code will derive from classes contained in this project.

### PatternBufferCompiler 

The library containing the default C# PatternBufferCompiler class. This is NOT a command line application, but rather just a class that can compile C# PatternBuffers.

### PatternBufferCompilerProgram

This is a command line app wrapping the PatternBufferCompiler. It generates pbc-cs.exe, which is a standalone command line app dependent only on the .NET framework run-time.

### PatternBufferSchema

This contains a parser that can read .pb files, and the domain objects describing the contents of the .pb file. Both are used by the PatternBufferCompiler to ingest .pb schemas.

### PatternBufferTest
Exercises the APIs defined in the other libraries. Also generates some code into...

### PatternBufferGeneratedTest 
...which in turn exercises the code generated by the compiler for a few select schema test cases.

## Dependencies

You can see dependencies in the References node of your solution, but here they are, explicitly:

* PatternBuffer - None
* PatternBufferSchema - None
* PatternBufferCompiler - PatternBufferSchema
* PatternBufferCompilerProgram - PatternBufferCompiler, PatternBufferSchema
* PatternBufferGeneratedTest - PatternBuffer
* PatternBufferTest - PatternBuffer, PatternBufferCompiler, PatternBufferSchema
